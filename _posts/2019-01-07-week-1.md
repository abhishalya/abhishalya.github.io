This is the last day of the first week of January. The results of GCI are
supposed to be announced today at 22:30 IST but I'm not that curious for the
results since I have already blown up the chance of winning something.

In GCI I was only able to complete 10 tasks which is far less than many of the
other candidates. I still have 3 years left for GCI, hence I think I can get
better eventually and finally have a go with the prize.

This week was fun, the only thing I missed is the lack of coala maintainers.
I'm not able to contribute anything to coala currently since there are very few
active maintainers and a lot of stuff is dependent upon them. I think the
maintainers specially [jayvdb](https://github.com/jayvdb) should be free until
next week.

I participated in 3 contests in total.

1. January Long Challenge (ongoing)
2. Hello 2019
3. Codeforces Round 530 Div. 2

All three of them were very good. I started to realize that I make big mistakes,
and most of the times I miss some of the required points in the problem.
I have pushed the solutions to both of the Codeforces contests on Github.

I still need to solve more problems, specially harder ones, that is the only
way I can get better with problem solving.

I will post the discussion for the long contest in the upcoming blog post.

Keep smiling :smile:
