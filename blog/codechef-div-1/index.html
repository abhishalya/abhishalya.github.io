I was only able to participate in two contests this week:</p> <ol> <li><p>Codeforces Round 533</p> <li><p>CodeChef January Cook-off</p> </ol> <p>I have already uploaded the solutions to the problems I tried on Github. I&#39;m very happy that I was finally able to make my way to CodeChef Div 1&#33; The problems in the cook-off were surprisingly very easy, though I haven&#39;t upsolved any of them yet. But overall difficulty seemed simple or easy, but interestingly there were very few submissions on the harder problems. I don&#39;t know if that has to do with university exams or something else but there was less participation I think which is why the results were poor.</p> <p>I&#39;m very interested to solve all of those problems and have a good understanding of why they had poor submissions on them. Also I will upsolve the Codeforces problems which IMO were as expected. I was able to solve two of them perfectly and the third one had one DP solution which I had no idea during the contest. Seems like I have to improve my DP approach to the problems.</p> <p>This was mostly it, the week was tiring as always. I really hope of some good holidays to come in the near weeks. Also interestingly I started watching Narcos &#40;a series on Netflix&#41; just because I love Breaking Bad. It seems to be fun, I&#39;ll have some more episodes to watch this week.</p> <p>Thanks for reading, seeya next week ;&#41;</p> </div> </main> </div> <footer> &copy; Abhinav Kaushlya.
