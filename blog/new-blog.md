New blog is up and running now! I always wanted to improve my blog and
portfolio site and it is finally ready now. The best part is this site is
generated using [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) package.

# Code blocks

Here are some of the code blocks

```julia
using Franklin

# some comment here
newsite("My new site name"; template="hyde")
```

```py
from django import models

class TestModel(models.Model):
    """
    This is some random docstring
    """
    pass
```
