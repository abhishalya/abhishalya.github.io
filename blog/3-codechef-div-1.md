So there was a long gap in the contests on Codeforces. I was only able to
participate in two contests this week:

1. Codeforces Round 533
2. CodeChef January Cook-off

I have already uploaded the solutions to the problems I tried on Github.
I'm very happy that I was finally able to make my way to CodeChef Div 1!
The problems in the cook-off were surprisingly very easy, though I haven't
upsolved any of them yet. But overall difficulty seemed simple or easy, but
interestingly there were very few submissions on the harder problems. I don't
know if that has to do with university exams or something else but there was
less participation I think which is why the results were poor.

I'm very interested to solve all of those problems and have a good understanding
of why they had poor submissions on them. Also I will upsolve the Codeforces
problems which IMO were as expected. I was able to solve two of them perfectly
and the third one had one DP solution which I had no idea during the contest.
Seems like I have to improve my DP approach to the problems.

This was mostly it, the week was tiring as always. I really hope of some good
holidays to come in the near weeks. Also interestingly I started watching Narcos
(a series on Netflix) just because I love Breaking Bad. It seems to be fun,
I'll have some more episodes to watch this week.

Thanks for reading, seeya next week ;)
