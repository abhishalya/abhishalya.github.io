# MLH Fellowship

I've been selected as a part of MLH Fellowship program where I will be working
on Julia projects as an open-source contributor. During this program, I will
be primarily contributing to [Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai) and
[Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/) solving some of
the most important issues.
I had also applied for a need-based stipend and I will be getting a decent
compensation for my contributions which will help our family for the recent
financial situation.

I would like to thank MLH for giving me this opportunity to work with some of
the smartest people at Julia community. I will make sure that my contributions
make way to improving the experience with the mentioned packages.

One of the nicest things about this program is that you have potential to learn
a lot from your contributions to the projects you choose to work with. As I'm
new to Flux.jl, I will be learning a lot from the community and will help me
a lot in understanding the math behind the machine learning algorithms.

Although it has been some time since the start of the program, I'm excited
getting some of my very first contributions merged upstream. I'll definitely
write more posts as I continue with my journey.
