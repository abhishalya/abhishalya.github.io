This year I was mainly concentrating on Julia tasks. I think you get to learn much more when you stick to one org. While looking through the tasks I found this one where we have to explain that we can do 0-based indexing in Julia.</p> <p>For those who are not familiar with Julia, it has 1-based indexing. Hence, all the arrays, vectors start from 1 rather than from 0 &#40;as in many other programming languages&#41;. Initially, I didn&#39;t think if it was much of a deal, since I never actually thought people would judge the programming language based on whether it has a 0-based on 1-based indexing.</p> <p>But, to my surprise I saw <a href="https://redd.it/e71l4y">the comments on this post on reddit</a> and that made up my mind to do this task. So, there are a lot of things Julia docs says about indexing, and yeah sometimes it might just be possible that the 0-based indexing is better then 1-based.</p> <p>I&#39;m just writing here about how you can implement 0-based indexing using <a href="https://github.com/JuliaArrays/OffsetArrays.jl">OffsetArrays.jl</a>. Along with the relative indexing it offers many other features which you may want from Julia but are not available out of the box.</p> <p>For this task, we are concerned about the 0-based indexing and in order to do that you can simply declare an OffsetArray in the following manner:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">julia&gt; <span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> OffsetArrays

julia&gt; x = OffsetArray([<span class=hljs-number >1</span>, <span class=hljs-number >2</span>, <span class=hljs-number >3</span>], <span class=hljs-number >0</span>:<span class=hljs-number >2</span>)
<span class=hljs-number >3</span>-element OffsetArray(::<span class=hljs-built_in >Array</span>{<span class=hljs-built_in >Int64</span>,<span class=hljs-number >1</span>}, <span class=hljs-number >0</span>:<span class=hljs-number >2</span>) with eltype <span class=hljs-built_in >Int64</span> with indices <span class=hljs-number >0</span>:<span class=hljs-number >2</span>:
 <span class=hljs-number >1</span>
 <span class=hljs-number >2</span>
 <span class=hljs-number >3</span></code></pre> <p>Here I&#39;m just creating a vector with the values <code>1, 2, 3</code> with a relative indexing of 0 to 2. Hence, if I ran:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">julia&gt; x[<span class=hljs-number >0</span>]
<span class=hljs-number >1</span></code></pre> <p>or if I ran:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">julia&gt; x[<span class=hljs-number >2</span>]
<span class=hljs-number >3</span></code></pre> <p>or even this:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">julia&gt; x[<span class=hljs-keyword >end</span>]
<span class=hljs-number >3</span></code></pre> <p>it would work just as you&#39;d expect from a 0-based indexed vector.</p> <p>I feel this blog post was more designed to make people aware that they <strong>can</strong> do 0-based indexing if they want. There are many packages which can help you with your task.</p> <p>I hope this helped. Thank you :&#41;</p> </div> </main> </div> <footer> &copy; Abhinav Kaushlya.
