During this program, I will be primarily contributing to <a href="https://fluxml.ai">Flux.jl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/">Documenter.jl</a> solving some of the most important issues. I had also applied for a need-based stipend and I will be getting a decent compensation for my contributions which will help our family for the recent financial situation.</p> <p>I would like to thank MLH for giving me this opportunity to work with some of the smartest people at Julia community. I will make sure that my contributions make way to improving the experience with the mentioned packages.</p> <p>One of the nicest things about this program is that you have potential to learn a lot from your contributions to the projects you choose to work with. As I&#39;m new to Flux.jl, I will be learning a lot from the community and will help me a lot in understanding the math behind the machine learning algorithms.</p> <p>Although it has been some time since the start of the program, I&#39;m excited getting some of my very first contributions merged upstream. I&#39;ll definitely write more posts as I continue with my journey.</p> </div> </main> </div> <footer> &copy; Abhinav Kaushlya.
